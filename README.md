I am the most amazing person in the world. No one even compares to my
unfiltered greatness. If you gaze upon me, I am not liable for any damage
from my sheer awesomeness. If you doubt me, then you are shmuck.

    Married to a Filipina, Oregonian, I love Smash Bros.  Dancer, surfer, and looking into crypto.
Still waiting to be sealed, love Thai curry, and working on my Mandarin and Tagalog.  Will probably
break something in Python, and only fix it on the 11th hour.

	Bro I'm just vibin. Player of video games and waster of time. (Technically) a convert to the church,
served a mission in Colorado, and an almost-career-chef. I've eaten so much spicy food that it had 
permanently damaged my digestive system and now I can't eat spicy food anymore :(
